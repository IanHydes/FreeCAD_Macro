# FreeCAD_Macro

A repositry for my modified View_Rotation Macro that now includes Zoom in and Zoom out buttons.
The Zoom level on my mouse scroll wheel was too coarse an increment. The buttons on the rotate view macro allow a finer control of the zoom level.
The code is pulled from:

which perhaps bears some resemblance to:
